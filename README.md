# Aiden's-Impact 100 Project
Our Group Project is undertaken to deliver an impactful report for Impact100 Sydney, to support and enhance its efforts in providing to the local community. We have identified three key personas, each offering a unique perspective in contributing to the growth and development of Impact100 Sydney.

Three persona's unique perspectives are: A business analytics professional graduate who aims to develop publicly available data into a coherent visual representation of the Impact 100 Chapters, A corporate social responsibility manager committing to developing social impact investment and corporate philanthropy to benefit their company image, and finally a fundraising manager that desires to secure additional funding to begin non-profit events and activities.

From these perspectives, our goal is to determine the next sector of focus, secure funding from highly valued clients and corporations, and streamline Impact100 Sydneyâ€™s application process.
